The next step is to click 'Widgets' (under the 'Appearance' menu in the dashboard) and Drag and drop the 'Komoona Advertising - CPM Adverts' widget from the 'Available Widget' area to the 'Widget' area and click 'save'.

For the first few days A 'Place Holder' banner appears on your site, once your site is approved by the Komoona team, CPM Advertising will appear on your page with a small 'Advertise Here' button under the placement

The size of the banner, it's location on the page, the price of the adverts and the banner design are all customizeable via your Control Panel (review below)

When a reader/advertiser clicks the 'Place Holder' button the Komoona tool launches, the advertiser chooses to upload an existing advert or create one.
 
Uploading is done by locating the file the advertiser wants to use. CREATING adverts lets the advertiser get creative and build a banner from scratch.

Komoona offers a few neat templates and gives the option of creating your own custom banner templates in your Control Panel.
 
Once the adverts are ready your advertiser goes on to the final stage which is choosing how long he wants to buy the ad space for and choosing a payment method. 

Currently advertisers can pay with PayPal(authorized sites can offer c.card as well) another option in the drop down menu is called "WebMaster Code" and allows you to upload test banners / ads or give away ads without having to pay for them. 

Once the payment was made an instant email notification goes out to both the advertiser and the yourself. The email notifies you of the new advert and asks the publisher to review and either accept (publish = make money) or decline it. 

If the you choose to decline the advert no charge is made to the advertiser. 3 days prior to the expiration of the adverts, an automatic email goes out to the advertisers prompting them to renew their advertising campaign.
