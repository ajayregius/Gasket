= How does Komoona's 'Google AdSense Companion' work? =

After Installing/downloading the plugin you'll need to go to the 'settings' section of the 'Google AdSense Companion' plugin and perform a few steps:

1. Paste your entire Google AdSense code. 
2. Provide your email (it will also use as your username) and choose a password
3. Set the price you want to get when an advertiser wants to replace your Google AdSense with his ad
4. Choose the way you bill the advertiser - either use your own PayPal Merchant account or use Komoona billing (for a small fee) 
5. Accept the terms of service.

Your account is now created! 
The next step is to click 'Widgets' (under the 'Apperance' menu in the dashboard) and Drag and drop the 'Komoona ads' widget from the 'Available Widget' area to the 'Widget' area and click 'save'.


On your blog - A small 'Place Holder' banner appears under the Google Adsense placement on your blog and prompts the reader/advertiser to replace Google AdSense and start advertising. 
The price of the ads, the offered time frames, amount of ads and the banner design are all customizable from your **Control Panel** (review below)


When a reader/advertiser clicks the 'Place Holder' banner under the Google AdSense placement, the main Komoona tool launches, the advertiser chooses to upload an existing banner or create a new ad from scratch.
**Uploading ads** is done by locating the file the advertiser wants to use. **Creating ads** lets the advertiser get creative and build a banner from scratch.
Komoona offers a few neat templates and gives publishers the option of creating their own custom template in their Control Panel.


Once the ad is ready the advertiser goes on to the final stage which is choosing how long he wants to buy the ad space and replace Google AdSense for, and choosing a payment method. 
Currently advertisers can pay via PayPal and on varified blogs Credit Card payment is also available, There's another option in the drop down menu "Webmaster Code" which allows publishers to upload test ads or give away ads without having to pay for them. 


Once the payment was made an instant email notification goes out to both the advertiser and the publisher. The email notifies them of the new ads and asks the publisher to review the banner and either 'Accept' (publish = replace Google Adsense = make more money) or decline it. 
If the publisher approves the new ad, Google AdSense is replaced. 3 days prior to the expiration of the ads, an automatic email goes out to the advertisers prompting them to renew the ads by submitting new banners. If the advertiser decides not to renew his ads, the Google AdSense ads will automatically return once the ad expires.
If the publisher chooses to decline the ad, no charge is made to the advertiser and the Google AdSense ad unit remains active.
